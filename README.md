# SeaGB
SeaGB is a Gameboy emulator written in C that uses SDL2 as a frontend.

The end goals are to have near 100% compatibility with the gameboy library, reasonably accurate timing, full unit testing, debug tools, support for user-defined palettes, input remapping, gamepad support, and possible gameboy color support.
